# Language Criteria
| **Grade** | **Description** | **Criteria** |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **5 (Outstanding)** | Exceptionally clear, precise, and tailored communication. | - Clear, concise, and precise language, free from errors. <br> - Engaging and relevant, tailored to the user's needs and context. <br> - Provides comprehensive and thorough explanations. <br> - Utilizes user-specific terminology and adapts to the user's knowledge level. <br> - Ensures inclusivity and accessibility in language use. |
| **4 (Very Good)** | Clear communication with minor room for improvement. | - Mostly clear language with occasional ambiguity or minor errors. <br> - Generally engaging but may lack some contextual depth. <br> - Sufficient explanations provided but could benefit from more detail in places. <br> - Largely tailored to the user's needs, with slight discrepancies. <br> - Language is mostly inclusive and accessible. |
| **3 (Satisfactory)** | Adequate communication but with noticeable areas for enhancement. | - Understandable language but with noticeable imprecision or errors. <br> - Engagement and relevance to context are present but inconsistent. <br> - Explanations are provided but may lack clarity or completeness. <br> - Some effort to tailor language to the user, but with evident mismatches. <br> - Language use shows an attempt at inclusivity and accessibility. |
| **2 (Needs Improvement)** | Communication is unclear or incorrect in several aspects. | - Language is often unclear or contains multiple errors. <br> - Lacks engagement and fails to relate closely to the context or user's needs. <br> - Explanations are either overly simplistic, incorrect, or missing. <br> - Little to no tailoring of language to the user's knowledge level or needs. <br> - Inclusivity and accessibility in language use are largely neglected. |
| **1 (Unacceptable)** | Communication is largely ineffective, with pervasive issues. | - Language is unclear, incorrect, or incomprehensible. <br> - Engagement and relevance to context are absent. <br> - Explanations are misleading, incorrect, or entirely absent. <br> - Language is not tailored to the user and fails to consider their needs or level of understanding. <br> - Language use is exclusionary or inaccessible. |

# Code Criteria

| **Grade** | **Description** | **Criteria** |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **5 (Outstanding)** | Code is exemplary in terms of correctness, efficiency, and readability. | - Correct and produces the expected output. <br> - Optimized for efficiency and speed without compromising readability. <br> - Adheres to best practices and coding standards. <br> - Well-commented and documented for clarity. <br> - Code is robust and includes error handling. |
| **4 (Very Good)** | Code is correct with minor areas for optimization. | - Correct output with minor inefficiencies. <br> - Generally adheres to best practices but may include some non-idiomatic constructs. <br> - Documentation and comments are present but could be improved for better clarity. <br> - Code is mostly robust but may lack comprehensive error handling. |
| **3 (Satisfactory)** | Code is functional but with noticeable areas for improvement. | - Produces correct output but with noticeable inefficiencies or convoluted logic. <br> - Inconsistent adherence to coding standards and best practices. <br> - Comments and documentation are present but may be unclear or insufficient. <br> - Some attempt at error handling, but not comprehensive. |
| **2 (Needs Improvement)** | Code has significant issues but shows some understanding of the task. | - May produce incorrect output or be partially complete. <br> - Limited adherence to best practices, with prevalent non-idiomatic code. <br> - Minimal or no comments and documentation, making the code hard to follow. <br> - Negligible error handling, leading to potential failures. |
| **1 (Unacceptable)** | Code is largely incorrect, incomplete, or incoherent. | - Fails to produce the correct output or is largely incomplete. <br> - Disregards coding standards and best practices. <br> - Lacks comments and documentation, rendering the code unintelligible. <br> - No consideration of error handling, leading to fragile code. |
